### :joystick:How to setup storybook locally

- Before starting the Storybook environment locally, install all the required dependencies. Run the command below to install the dependencies:

```cmd
npm install --save-dev
```

- Now, as you have all the `node_modules` installed in your project, you can start the Storybook environment. Run the command below to start it:

```cmd
npm run storybook
```

- This will start your local Storybook environment on port `6006` by default.
