Atom is the design system behind [Studio](https://github.com/asyncapi/studio).

It's structured in the following way:

* [Atoms](?path=/story/atoms-introduction--page): The smallest elements of the system.
* [Molecules](?path=/story/molecules-introduction--page): Groups of atoms, functional elements that work on their own.
* [Organisms](?path=/story/organisms-introduction--page): Groups of atoms and molecules, larger components that function on their own.
